# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

 In this Kaggle dataset, I built classfication models using decision tree, KNN, logistic regression, and SVM to predict the diagnose result based on ten real-valued features. Also, I applied cross validation and grid serach technique to find the best parameter and avoid ovetfitting. Finally, based on accuracy scores, I found the logistic regression model performed the best.
 {'Decision Tree': 0.94, 'KNN': 0.96, 'Logistic Regression': 0.98, 'SVM': 0.97}
 To provide more information on model performace, I calculated classification report, AUC, kappa, MCC and plotted the ROC curve.
